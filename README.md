# 3160-FinalProject
Project for ITCS 3160 with Nicole Hite, Sean Oberer, Ryan Collins, Marcus Pierce, and Taylor Ford

## Table of Contents
### - Introduction
We want to give students the most affordable and convenient way to have food delivered to them on campus. We know that universities
prefer not to have people who are not affiliated with their institution come on to campus property. With our project, NinerEats, we 
want to give students at UNC Charlotte a convenient way to have food delivered by other students. By doing this, this will prevent 
people who are not directly affiliated with the university from coming on to the college campus and it will also provide an opportunity 
for college students to make some money since this is a food delivery service for college students by college students.
