Project Purpose:
Due to several concerns over health and safety, delivering food to the UNCC campus grounds is becoming more difficult by the day. 
Because of this, campus officials tend to not like the idea of delivery systems on campus unless it is operated by the University 
itself. To solve this matter, we will be starting a company which gives the University guaranteed full control of the delivery system. 

Project Objectives:
We want to give students the most affordable and convenient way to have food delivered to them on campus. We know that universities
prefer not to have people who aren't affiliated with their institution come to campus so with our project, we want to give students
a convenient way to have food delivered by other students. By doing this, this will prevent people who aren't directly affiliated with
the university from coming to college campuses and it will also provide an opportunity for college students to make some money
since this is a food delivery service for college students by college students.
